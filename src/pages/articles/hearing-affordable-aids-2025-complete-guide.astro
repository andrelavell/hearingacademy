<h2>Understanding Affordable Hearing Aids</h2>
<p>The landscape of affordable hearing aids has transformed dramatically since the FDA approved over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids in 2022. Today, adults with mild to moderate hearing loss can access quality hearing devices without the traditional barriers of high costs and mandatory audiologist visits. OTC hearing aids have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), allowing them to be sold in established retail stores like Walmart, Best Buy, Costco and online retailers without the need for a medical prescription or audiologist fitting.</p>
<h3>The Cost Revolution in Hearing Healthcare</h3>
<p>Traditional prescription hearing aids typically range from $3,000 to $10,000 per pair, with Members paid a median of $2,592 for a pair of prescription hearing aids, according to our survey. In contrast, Members paid a median of $963 for a pair of OTC hearing aids, according to our survey. This significant price difference makes hearing healthcare accessible to millions more Americans.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3><strong>What&#39;s the difference between OTC and prescription hearing aids?</strong></h3>

Prescription hearing aids require professional fitting and can treat all levels of hearing loss, including severe and profound cases. Prescription hearing aids can treat all levels of hearing loss, but they&#39;re the only option for those with severe or profound loss—which OTCs aren&#39;t equipped to address.</p>

<ul>
<li>Daily wear time</li>
